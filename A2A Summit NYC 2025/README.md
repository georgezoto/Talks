## Introduction

I recently attended the **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Summit** in San Francisco, and the energy was palpable. If 2023 was the year of the LLM, and 2024 is the year of the Agent, then 2025 is shaping up to be the year of the **Internet of Agents**.

The core premise of the summit was simple yet profound: the internet, as we know it, was designed for humans to navigate. However, we are rapidly moving toward a future where the primary "users" of the internet will be AI agents interacting with other AI agents.

## The Paradigm Shift: From B2C/B2B to A2A

For decades, we’ve operated in frameworks like Business-to-Consumer (B2C) or Business-to-Business (B2B). The A2A Summit highlighted the emergence of **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** communication as the new standard for digital interaction.

In this new paradigm:

* **Humans** set goals and guardrails.
* **Agents** negotiate, execute tasks, and exchange value.
* **Infrastructure** shifts from being human-centric (GUIs) to being agent-centric (APIs and structured data).

## Key Takeaways from the Summit

### 1. The Emergence of the Agentic Stack

We are seeing the crystallization of a new "Agentic Stack." This includes:

* **Compute & Models:** The foundational layer (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta).
* **Agent Frameworks:** Tools like LangChain, CrewAI, and PydanticAI that help build the "brain."
* **Memory & Context:** Vector databases and long-term memory solutions.
* **Connectivity & Protocols:** This is the "A2A" layer—how agents find and talk to each other.

### 2. The Need for Standardization

One of the hottest topics was the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** recently introduced by Anthropic, and other emerging standards. For the Internet of Agents to scale, we need universal protocols for:

* **Discovery:** How does my agent find your agent?
* **Authentication:** How do agents verify each other’s identity?
* **Negotiation:** How do they agree on terms of service or price?

### 3. Identity and Security in an Agent-First World

If an agent is acting on my behalf, how do I ensure it doesn't overstep? The summit delved deep into **Proof of Personhood** and **Delegated Authority**. We need cryptographic "handshakes" that allow agents to prove they have the permission to spend money or access sensitive data without exposing the user's primary credentials.

### 4. New Economic Models

We are moving toward a "Micro-transaction Economy." When agents talk to agents, they might perform thousands of tiny tasks per hour. Traditional credit card processing isn't built for 0.01-cent transactions. This is where blockchain and stablecoins are finding a real, pragmatic use case—providing the rails for high-frequency, low-value agentic commerce.

## The "Agentic Web" vs. The "Legacy Web"

The "Legacy Web" is made of HTML meant to be rendered by a browser for a human eye. The "Agentic Web" is made of structured schemas (JSON, Tools, Functions) meant to be parsed by a model.

Speakers emphasized that companies that don't provide "agent-friendly" interfaces (APIs) will effectively become invisible to the next generation of internet users (the agents).

## Conclusion: The Path Forward

The A2A Summit made one thing clear: we aren't just building smarter chatbots; we are re-architecting the fabric of the digital economy. The transition to an Internet of Agents will be as significant as the transition from desktop to mobile.

As we move forward, the focus will shift from "What can this AI tell me?" to "What can this AI *do* for me by collaborating with the rest of the world?"

**The Internet of Agents isn't coming; it's being built right now.**
